=======================================
To synchronize your work, you run:
https://git-scm.com/book/id/v2/Git-Branching-Remote-Branches
git fetch origin

git push -u origin mybranch-1
git push origin mybranch-1
or
git push origin mybranch-1:mybranch-1

===============================================
https://git-scm.com/book/id/v2/Git-Branching-Remote-Branches

git fetch :
fetch down all the changes on the server that you don’t have yet,
it will not modify your working directory at all.
It will simply get the data for you and let you merge it yourself. 

git pull:
essentially a git fetch immediately followed by a git merge in most cases. 
========================

Delete remote branch if it is merged merged

git checkout develop
git branch --merged
  develop
* feature-D1
git branch -d feature-D1
git push origin --delete feature-D1

========================================
Rebase:
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing

(example1 1)
git checkout feature-C1
git rebase develop

First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...
Applying: 9 and 10 line in feature-C1
Using index info to reconstruct a base tree...
M       myfile.txt
Falling back to patching base and 3-way merge...
Auto-merging myfile.txt
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in myfile.txt
error: Failed to merge in the changes.
Patch failed at 0001 9 and 10 line in feature-C1
The copy of the patch that failed is found in: .git/rebase-apply/patch

When you have resolved this problem, run "git rebase --continue".
If you prefer to skip this patch, run "git rebase --skip" instead.
To check out the original branch and stop rebasing, run "git rebase --abort".

git add myfile.txt
git rebase --continue
git checkout develop
git merge feature-C1

git log --oneline --decorate
